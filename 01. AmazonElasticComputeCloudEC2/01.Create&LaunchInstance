Set Up New Instance EC2
    Instance
     - Is a virtual server that runs on the AWS cloud
     - Each instance type offers different compute and memory capabilities. 
     - Select an instance type based on the amount of memory and computing power that you need for the application or 
       software that you plan to run on the instance. 
    
    Steps:
     - Sign into the AWS Management Console
     - EC2 Service section
     - Launch new Instance
       - Give a name
       - Choose Amazon Machine Image(AMI): This is a template that constains the software config:
         - OS, app server and apps required to launch our instance!
           e.g Ubuntu 22 free tier!
       - Choose Instance Type: This determinates the hardware of the host computer used 
                               Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities, 
                               and is grouped in an instance family based on these capabilities
                               e.g 
                                - Computed optimized
                                - Storage optimized
                                - Accelerated computing
                                - General Purpose
                                - Memory Optimized
                                =>> Select free tier!
       - Key pair(login): We use a kew pair to securely connect to our instance. Ensure that we have access to the selected key pair 
                          before you launch the instance.
                          e.g my-aws-key
       - Network settings:
         - Firewall => create a security group
                       - rules:
                         - Allow SSH, Allow HTTPs, Allow HTTP!
       - Final => LAUNCH !

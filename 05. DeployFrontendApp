Deploy front-end app from windows
    Once we have build our app using:
     - ng build
    and we have created our dist/ folder which contains the production app, we need to deploy it!

    Steps:
     - Connect to server via SSH 
     - create a new folder for front-end app in the EC2 instance:
       ❯ sudo mkdir opt/front-end
     - To transfer files from our local folder into the EC2 instance, we need to change owner:
       ❯ sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu /opt/front-end
     - To transfer using the PuTTY Secure Copy Protocol(pscp), we need to install:(check pscp -v !)
       ❯ sudo apt-install putty-tools
     - Transfer the compiled app(/dist) to the server via ssh; run in the windows poweshell:
       ❯ pscp -i <path-to-key-file> -r <path-to-local-dist-folder>\* ubuntu@<domain name>:/opt/front-end

       - <path-to-key-file>  =                  C:\Users\USUARIO\Desktop\H\AWS\my-aws-key.ppk 
       - <path-to-local-dist-folder>\*  =       C:\Users\USUARIO\Desktop\H\Apps\angular-demo\auth-demo\dist\auth-demo\*
       - ubuntu@<domain name>:/opt/front-end  =  ubuntu@ec2-18-231-191-60.sa-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/opt/front-end

       ❯ pscp -i  C:\Users\USUARIO\Desktop\H\AWS\my-aws-key.ppk -r C:\Users\USUARIO\Desktop\H\Apps\angular-demo\auth-demo\dist\auth-demo\* ubuntu@ec2-18-231-191-60.sa-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/opt/front-end

Deploy backend app
    We need to deploy our node.js + MongoDB integration => APIs!

    Node App:
     - When develop node apps, we don't build any kind of dist/ folder. Instead we just have our index/server file
       and all the related modules and config per environment!
     - So we have our Node app in a folder, can be directly a repo or part of a global repo!
       
    /opt/ directory in linux:
     - This is reserved for the installation of add-on application software packages
     - This means software that is not part of the system

    Steps:
     - Create a directory for backend app: 
       - sudo mkdir /opt/back-end
     - In case we have all the backend app in a repo, we can clone it:
       - sudo git clone repoAddress /opt/back-end
     - Navigate into the back-end directory and install all required npm packages:
       - cd /opt/back-end && sudo npm install
     - Start the node app(APIs) using the PM2 process manager:
       - sudo pm2 start server.js/index.js
    

    The API is now running on Node.js under the PM2 process manager and listening on port 4000. Only port 80 (HTTP) is 
    publicly accessible on the server so we can't hit the API yet!
    
    We will access to the API after we've configured NGINX as a reverse proxy to pass through HTTP traffic to the api!
